# ðŸ“Š Board Game Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of over 10,000 board games to uncover insights that can help a retail company design a data-informed sales strategy for the upcoming Winter season.

Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I performed data wrangling, statistical exploration, and visual storytelling to answer key business questions such as:

- What are the top 5 highest-rated games?
- Is there a correlation between user ratings and playtime?
- How are game categories distributed? *(with NLP preprocessing techniques)*
- Do older games (pre-1992) have higher median ratings than newer ones?
- What are the 5 most common game mechanics?

Additionally, I formulated and explored a custom statistical question about the correlation between average ratings and minimum player age.

ðŸ“Œ The entire analysis includes:
- Python-based data cleaning and feature engineering
- Custom visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Text preprocessing using NLTK
- Insight-driven conclusions to support strategic decision-making
